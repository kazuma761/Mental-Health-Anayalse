79,346.4,348.55,Participant,hmm <sigh> let's see,449
80,349.28,351.96,Participant,i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old,449
81,352.47,357.1,Participant,and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it,449
82,357.45,364.29,Participant,he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him,449
83,364.67,366.3,Participant,as opposed to waiting him to call me,449
84,366.77,367.26,Participant,and i think,449
85,367.94,377.03,Participant,it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come,449
86,377.39,379.35,Participant,and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place,449
87,379.75,387.77,Participant,but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but,449
88,388.215,396.96,Participant,i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult,449
89,397.355,399.735,Participant,and then also not expected him to just kinda you know,449
90,401.06,405.17,Participant,i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense,449
91,404.751,405.221,Ellie,uh_huh (uh huh),449
92,407.019,408.969,Ellie,easy_parent (do you find it easy to be a parent),449
93,409.54,418.05,Participant,woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and,449
94,418.96,424.84,Participant,i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so,449
95,425.43,428.59,Participant,it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally,449
96,428.92,429.48,Participant,so,449
97,429.78,437.31,Participant,my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect,449
98,437.735,443.405,Participant,so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect,449

102,456.63,461.12,Participant,but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just,449
103,461.48,468.36,Participant,kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that,449
104,468.765,475.52,Participant,i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own,449
105,475.88,479.74,Participant,and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but,449
106,480.13,486.1,Participant,whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me,449

110,496.72,499.99,Participant,it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy,449
111,500.44,504.13,Participant,um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own,449
112,504.55,509.26,Participant,and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just,449
113,509.72,515.38,Participant,being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that,449
114,517.156,520.992,Ellie,parent_differences (what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents),449
115,521.01,527.24,Participant,wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here,449
116,527.605,533.245,Participant,so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing,449
117,533.58,537.78,Participant,it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure,449
118,538.26,541.14,Participant,uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling,449
119,541.5,547.86,Participant,but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter,449
120,548.18,551.81,Participant,so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent,449

123,566.097,570.737,Participant,and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore,449
124,571.13,571.62,Participant,and,449
125,571.92,583.02,Participant,since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while,449
126,583.51,588.17,Participant,um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just,449
127,588.595,593.935,Participant,did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of,449
128,594.3,597.58,Participant,how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything,449
129,598.0,601.13,Participant,physical and and all the material stuff i could care less,449
130,601.5,605.81,Participant,but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about,449
131,606.557,607.987,Ellie,change_directions (what made you decide to do that),449
132,608.7,620.13,Participant,uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that,449
133,620.6,630.41,Participant,he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it,449
134,631.31,635.37,Participant,bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home,449
135,635.75,647.06,Participant,and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through,449
136,647.5,657.23,Participant,and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself,449
137,657.57,662.97,Participant,in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return,449
